# XR Defense

This repository hosts the BURGS Project "Exploting Power Telemetry to Expose XR User Environmental Information". This repository hosts all of the team's work to investigate how performance indicators can be exploited to expose an XR User's location type. The project began with the an AR headset called the Magic Leap 2. We are expanding the work to alternative headsets and XR design.

        "Type 1 questions ask about one specific fact and do not require multi-step reasoning. Further, each of these questions has answers that are subject to change. None of the questions has answers that are guaranteed to be set in stone. Type 1 questions contain phrases like \"latest\" and \"this year.\" Answers to questions inquiring about this year will have different answers depending on when they are asked. On the other hand, some Type 2 questions have stable, unchanging answers. However, Type 2 questions require multiple pieces of information and a chain reaction of reasoning. These questions are really asking multiple questions in one. For example, the Type 2 question \"In which country was the richest woman in the world born?\" requires first obtaining the name of the richest woman in the world, then performing an additional search to find out which country she was born in. If this were a Type 1 question, it would be phrased more like 'In which country was Alice Walton born?\" Further, the answer to this question is unlikely to change within the next year, as wealth rankings shift relatively slowly, especially for women, often taking generations. Another example is the Type 2 question \"Which member of The Beatles was born first?\" One search is not enough to answer this question; a search must be made for each member of The Beatles's year of birth, and then the results of each of these queries must be compared to each other to find the minimum. Unlike many Type 1 questions, however, the answer to this question will never change; it is a historical fact. Type 1 questions differ in complexity; take the Type 1 question \"What is the title of Stephen King's most recent novel?\" for example. To fit the structure of a Type 2 question, it could be phrased as \"What is the title of the most recent novel by the author of It?\""

        "The model correctly answered questions 15, 16, 24, 29, 32, and 28. 6/40 correctly answered questions translates to 15% accuracy. The model's performance is poor due to a lack of up-to-date information. The questions answered correctly can be attributed to the fact that the answer has not changed in the past few years. You can gauge from the model's responses that the most recent data the model is using is from around 2023 to early 2024. However, it is doubtful that it has access to information from late 2024, as it was able to pull the date for Father's Day and Black Friday of 2024, which can be determined from the beginning of the year, but it did not recognize the presidential switch that occurred later that year. It is reasonable to state that the zero-shot approach is heavily limited for time-sensitive questions without access to current information. It did not only struggle due to a lack of up-to-date information, however. It also struggled with questions that rely on more complex reasoning, like question 33 regarding The Beatles. Regardless of whether the model is accessing curent data, it should have been able to retrieve all birth years and compare them accurately, but it failed to. This suggests that the model can see improved performance before we even feed it current information if we improve its reasoning abilities."

The list provided in step 2 mostly consists of UN-recognized countries. However, the exact count needs to consider if all listed countries are UN-recognized. For instance, Taiwan is not a UN-recognized country but has legalized same-sex marriage. Some countries may have legalized it in some jurisdictions but not nationwide (like Mexico). Assuming the list primarily includes UN-recognized countries and focusing on those that have federally legalized same-sex marriage, we count them.\\n\\nLet's simplify the count based on the information given and known data up to March 2023:\\n- The list includes around 30 countries that have legalized same-sex marriage at the federal level.\\n- All of these, except for a few special cases like Taiwan, are UN-recognized.\\n\\nLet's directly infer or look up the number of countries that have legalized same-sex marriage as of March 2023.

This is almost double the accuracy metric determined for zero-shot prompting. However, this improvement in accuracy is primarily attributable to enhanced performance on Type 2 questions. The above run showed 0% improvement for Type 1 questions, as they require the current date to be included in the prompt and access to up-to-date information, not advanced reasoning skills. The results shown above reflect one run of the model. In other runs on the FreshQA dataset, Type 1 questions showed minimal improvement, with at most one additional correct answer. Questions 3 and 6 were occasionally answered correctly in separate runs. These correct answers, however, were exceptional cases where the model assumed the current year is 2025, whereas for most questions, the model defaulted to assuming the year was 2023 or 2024. On the other hand, among Type 2 questions, 5 additional correct answers were observed. Type 2 questions are more often based on reasoning rather than year-sensitive, up-to-date information. Many of them were answered incorrectly with zero-shot prompting not due to the lack of current data, but due to the model's lack of reasoning ability. Many of the Type 2 answers are set in stone and will not change in the future. Therefore, improving the model's ability to decompose questions into subquestions and reason through them step-by-step was effective in boosting accuracy for Type 2 questions."

However, it is more plausible that she is referring to the spouse of the current Vice President, who is likely JD Vance.\\n\\nGiven that Joe Biden was the president until 2025, it is reasonable to assume the current president is the one who took office after him. However, the exact name of the current president isn't directly stated in the search results.\\n\\nHowever, one search result mentions Jill Biden as the spouse of Joe Biden, the 46th president from 2021 to 2025. Since Joe Biden is the most recent president mentioned, and given that his term ended in 2025, Jill Biden is likely the spouse of the previous president.\\n\\nAnother search result mentions Usha Vance as the Second Lady of the United States as of August 12, 2025. This implies that her husband is the current Vice President, making him the spouse of the current Vice President, not the current President.\\n\\nTherefore, to determine the second spouse of the current President, we need to identify the current President. If we assume the information about Usha Vance being the Second Lady is correct and up-to-date, it implies that her husband is the current Vice President. The spouse of the current President would then be the First Lady.\\n\\nHowever, the search results do not directly state who the current President is or their spouse. But we can infer that if Usha Vance is the Second Lady, her husband is the Vice President, and thus the current President's spouse is not Usha Vance.\\n\\nSince the search results do not directly state the name of the current President or their spouse, we can look at the most recent information. As Joe Biden's term ended in 2025, and there's a mention of Usha Vance being the Second Lady in August 2025, it suggests a new administration.\\n\\nThe search results do not provide a direct answer to the question.
